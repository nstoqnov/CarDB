# Spring Boot Exercise Project

This project is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with Spring Boot by working on basic CRUD operations with a `Trip` and `User` entity.

## Overview
The project provides a RESTful API to manage trips, allowing you to create, view, and delete trips stored in the database.

## API Endpoints

Here are the available endpoints:

- **GET** `/trips`  
  Returns all trips in the database.

- **POST** `/trips`  
  Creates a new trip.

- **GET** `/trips/{id}`  
  Retrieves a specific trip by its ID.

- **DELETE** `/trips/{id}`  
  Deletes a trip by its ID.

Each endpoint follows standard HTTP methods and returns JSON-formatted responses.
